# Design Patterns in the Spring Framework

Reference: [Design Patterns in the Spring Framework](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-framework-design-patterns)

There are four common design patterns used in Spring Framework:

- Singleton pattern
- Factory Method pattern
- Proxy pattern
- Template pattern

## Singleton Pattern

> The singleton pattern is a mechanism that ensures only one instance of an object exists per application

## Factory Method pattern

> The factory method pattern entails a factory class with an abstract method for creating the desired object.

## Proxy Pattern

> In code, the proxy pattern is a technique that allows one object — the proxy — to control access to another object — the subject or service.

## Template Method Pattern 

> The template method pattern is a technique that defines the steps required for some action, implementing the boilerplate steps, and leaving the customizable steps as abstract.
